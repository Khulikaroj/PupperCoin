This contract provide you  a platform to raise fund by crowfinding on Ethereum platform. You can follow crowfinding procedure step by step as belowed. 

## Contracts

* PupperCoin.sol
* CrowdSale.sol

## Deploy Contracts

### 1. Mint your coin.

Use `PupperCoin.sol` to mint your coin on minter account setted in the contract. Use `Remix` to compile and deploy the contract by providing neccesary variables such as `name`, `symbol`, and `initial supply`.

These are functions relevant to minting your coin.

### 2. Crowdsale.

Now you can sell your coin to raising fund by deploying `CrowdSale.sol` contract. Use `Remix` to compile and deploy the contract by providing neccesary variables such as `rate`, `token address`, `wallet address`and `goal`.  

For `rate`, you can hardcode a rate of 1, to maintain parity with Ether units (1 TKN per Ether, or 1 TKNbit per wei). If you'd like to customize your crowdsale rate, follow the Crowdsale Rate calculator on OpenZeppelin's documentation. Essentially, a token (TKN) can be divided into TKNbits just like Ether can be divided into wei. When using a rate of 1, just like 1000000000000000000 wei is equal to 1 Ether, 1000000000000000000 TKNbits is equal to 1 TKN.
